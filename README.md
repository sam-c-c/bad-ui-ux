## About

This was built as part of the React month challenge at work where people built the worst UI / UX experience using React.

I created a two page application for a made up company called KitchenProdz who sell kitchen equipment.

The issues with this application are:

- Colour scheme is awful and hasn't got great contrast. Coupled with the background makes it vomit inducing.
- There is a landing page that serves no benefit.
- Cookies notice on the landing page. Everyone loves a good cookie popup don't they?
- The button on the landing page to enter the site redirects back to the landing page. There is another button hidden on the left side of the page.
- On the products page, the layout has a navigation icon to take you to the products page but actually take you back to the landing page.
- The nav bar contains a don't click button. Don't press it.
- The products themselves are hard to read and included in a scrollbox.
- The View more button on the products is broken and actually causes the products to reorder in the UI.
- There is an order button at the top of the page that doesn't explain what what it does. It might reorder the products or you might get a nice treat through the post.
- Not mobile friendly as nobody uses their phone these days to view websites ;-)

## Getting Started

Built with Node v20.6.1.

First, run the development server:
